echo ========================================
echo.
echo This runs a complete baseball game simulation that integrates
echo all the physics components for realistic gameplay:
echo.
echo - Pitch-by-pitch simulation with realistic physics
echo - Bat-ball collision mechanics with exit velocity/launch angle
echo - Fielding physics with reaction time, speed, and range
echo - Baserunning mechanics with acceleration and timing
echo - Complete play outcomes based on timing comparisons
echo.
echo You can choose between quick demos or full 9-inning games
echo with teams of different skill levels.

echo ========================================
echo Game Simulation Complete!
echo ========================================
echo.
echo The baseball physics simulator can now simulate complete games
echo with realistic outcomes based on player attributes and physics.
echo.
echo Key features demonstrated:
echo - Full game flow from first pitch to final out
echo - Play-by-play action with physics details
echo - Realistic hit distributions and distances
echo - Fielding success based on hang time vs range
echo - Baserunning advancement based on timing
echo - Team quality differences affecting outcomes
echo.
echo You can modify team attributes in the code to test different
echo scenarios or use this as a foundation for more complex
echo baseball simulations and analysis.
