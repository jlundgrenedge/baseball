# Phase 3 Implementation Summary: Pitch Trajectory Module

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully implements a comprehensive pitch trajectory simulator with **100% validation test accuracy** (6/6 tests passing). The module simulates realistic pitch physics from mound to home plate, including different pitch types with characteristic spin and break patterns, and integrates seamlessly with the Phase 2 collision model.

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Pitch Type Definitions
Created 6 standard pitch types with realistic characteristics:
- **4-seam Fastball**: 93 mph, 2200 rpm, vertical spin axis (creates "rise")
- **2-seam Fastball**: 91.5 mph, 2000 rpm, tilted spin (arm-side movement)
- **Curveball**: 77 mph, 2500 rpm, topspin (large vertical drop)
- **Slider**: 85 mph, 2400 rpm, gyro spin (sharp horizontal break)
- **Changeup**: 83 mph, 1750 rpm, low efficiency (late fade)
- **Splitter**: 90 mph, 1200 rpm, tumbling action (sharp drop)

### 2. Pitch Physics Simulator
- Release point: 54.5 ft from plate, 6.8 ft high (adjustable)
- Gravity compensation in initial velocity calculation
- Spin-dependent aerodynamics (same physics as Phase 1)
- Custom stop condition when ball crosses plate

### 3. Pitch Break Calculation
Measures deviation from straight-line trajectory:
- **Vertical break**: Movement up/down (fastball "rises", curve drops)
- **Horizontal break**: Side-to-side movement
- **Total break**: Combined movement magnitude
- Realistic values: 5-20 inches depending on pitch type

### 4. Strike Zone Detection
- Width: 17 inches (1.42 ft)
- Height: 1.5-3.5 ft (knees to letters)
- Automatic strike/ball determination
- Accounts for spin-induced movement

### 5. Integration with Collision Model
`simulate_at_batter()` method returns pitch velocity and angle for collision physics:
```python
pitch_result = sim.simulate_at_batter(fastball)
collision = collision_model.full_collision(
    bat_speed_mph=70.0,
    pitch_speed_mph=pitch_result['pitch_speed'],  # 84 mph at plate
    pitch_trajectory_angle_deg=pitch_result['pitch_angle']  # 7.6°
)
# Returns realistic exit velocity, launch angle, spin
```
