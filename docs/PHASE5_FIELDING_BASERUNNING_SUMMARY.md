## Physics Validation

All mechanics have been validated against MLB benchmarks:

### Fielding Validation
- **Sprint Speeds**: 15.7-21.8 mph range matches MLB Statcast data
- **Reaction Times**: 0.0-0.5 second range realistic for elite to poor fielders
- **Throwing Velocities**: Position-specific ranges match scouting reports
- **Range Calculations**: Elite fielders catch difficult balls, poor fielders don't

### Baserunning Validation  
- **Home-to-First Times**: 3.7s (elite) to 5.2s (slow) matches MLB data
- **Sprint Speeds**: Consistent with fielding speeds and Statcast measurements
- **Turn Efficiency**: Speed loss during base rounding matches observed behavior
- **Sliding Physics**: Friction-based model produces realistic slide distances

### Integration Validation
- **Close Plays**: Timing tolerances implement "tie goes to runner" appropriately
- **Throw Accuracy**: Error rates realistic for different skill levels
- **Multi-Runner Plays**: Advancement logic follows baseball rules correctly

## Example Usage

```python
from batted_ball import (
    # Trajectory simulation
    BattedBallSimulator, create_standard_environment,
    # Players
    Pitcher, Hitter, 
    # Fielding and baserunning
    create_standard_defense, create_average_runner,
    simulate_play_from_trajectory
)

# Create batted ball
env = create_standard_environment()
simulator = BattedBallSimulator(env)
ball_result = simulator.simulate_trajectory(
    exit_velocity_mph=95, launch_angle_deg=15, 
    direction_deg=0, backspin_rpm=2200
)

# Set up defense and runners
defense = create_standard_defense()
batter_runner = create_average_runner("Batter")

# Simulate complete play
play_result = simulate_play_from_trajectory(
    ball_result, defense, batter_runner
)

print(f"Outcome: {play_result.outcome}")
print(f"Description: {play_result.play_description}")
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Fielding Calculations**: Sub-millisecond per fielder per play

## Integration with Existing Phases

### Phase 1-2 (Trajectory Physics)
- Uses same coordinate system and units
- Integrates ball landing position and hang time
- Maintains physics consistency throughout

### Phase 3 (Pitch Simulation)  
- Ready for integration with pitch-by-pitch game simulation
- Fielding positions can adjust based on pitcher handedness
- Count-dependent positioning possible

### Phase 4 (Player Attributes)
- Fielding and baserunning attributes use same 0-100 scale

- Player development and fatigue can affect all attributes

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Advanced Positioning**: Shift patterns, count-based positioning
2. **Strategic Decisions**: When to throw, which base to target
3. **Communication**: Fielder-to-fielder coordination on difficult plays
4. **Environmental Effects**: Wind affecting throws, field conditions
5. **Injury Simulation**: Performance degradation due to injuries
6. **Umpire Calls**: Realistic call accuracy on close plays

## Conclusion
