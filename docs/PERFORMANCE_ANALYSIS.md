# Baseball Simulation Engine - Performance Analysis & Optimizations

## Current Performance Baseline

Based on our performance testing:

- **Normal Mode**: 257.4 ms per at-bat (DT_DEFAULT = 0.001s)
- **Fast Mode**: 124.2 ms per at-bat (DT_FAST = 0.002s) 
- **Current Speedup**: 2.07x faster with fast_mode
- **Projected Performance**: 100,000 at-bats = 7.2 hours (normal) vs 3.4 hours (fast)

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

### 1. Numerical Integration (Highest Impact)
**Current Status**: Already well-optimized with numba JIT compilation
- RK4 integration with adaptive time stepping
- Numba @njit decorators for hot path functions
- Fast mode reduces time step from 1ms to 2ms (2x speedup)

**Key Bottlenecks**:
- Multiple trajectory integrations per at-bat (4-8 pitches + potential batted balls)
- Each trajectory requires 50-200 integration steps
- Aerodynamic force calculations in tight loop

### 2. Memory Allocation Patterns
**Issues Identified**:
- Dynamic array resizing during trajectory integration
- NumPy array creation in hot loops
- Dictionary and object creation for each pitch/contact

### 3. At-Bat Simulation Loop
**Current Overhead**:
- Multiple physics simulations per at-bat
- Complex decision logic with random selections
- String comparisons and dictionary lookups

## Optimization Opportunities

### Tier 1: High Impact, Low Risk

#### 1. Pre-Allocation Strategy
```python
# Current: Dynamic allocation
positions = np.zeros((max_steps, 3))  # Reallocated each time

# Optimized: Pre-allocated buffers
class TrajectoryBuffer:
    def __init__(self, max_trajectories=10, max_steps=1000):
        self.position_buffer = np.zeros((max_trajectories, max_steps, 3))
        self.velocity_buffer = np.zeros((max_trajectories, max_steps, 3))
        self.time_buffer = np.zeros((max_trajectories, max_steps))
        self.current_index = 0
```

#### 2. Batch Processing Mode
```python
class BulkAtBatSimulator:
    """Optimized for large-scale simulations (10,000+ at-bats)"""
    
    def simulate_bulk(self, pitcher, hitter, n_at_bats, 
                     use_simplified_physics=True):
        # Pre-allocate all result arrays
        # Minimize object creation
        # Use vectorized operations where possible
```

#### 3. Caching Frequently Used Calculations
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_pitch_trajectory(velocity, spin_rate, release_point):
    # Cache common pitch trajectories
    
@lru_cache(maxsize=500) 
def cached_aerodynamic_coefficients(velocity_ms, spin_rate_rpm):
    # Cache drag/lift coefficients for common velocities
```

### Tier 2: Medium Impact, Medium Risk

#### 4. Simplified Physics Mode
```python
class SimplifiedAerodynamics:
    """Faster aerodynamics with lookup tables instead of calculations"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Pre-compute aerodynamic coefficients for velocity/spin ranges
        self.drag_lookup = self._build_drag_table()
        self.magnus_lookup = self._build_magnus_table()
    
    def calculate_forces_fast(self, velocity, spin):
        # Bilinear interpolation from lookup tables
        return self._interpolate_forces(velocity, spin)
```

#### 5. Reduced Precision Integration
```python
# For bulk analysis, use larger time steps with error compensation
DT_BULK = 0.005  # 5ms time step (5x faster)
DT_ULTRA_FAST = 0.01  # 10ms time step (10x faster, ~2% accuracy loss)
```

#### 6. Vectorized At-Bat Processing
```python
def simulate_at_bats_vectorized(pitchers, hitters, n_each=100):
    """Process multiple at-bats simultaneously using NumPy vectorization"""
    # Batch process swing decisions
    # Vectorize contact calculations
    # Parallel trajectory calculations
```

### Tier 3: High Impact, Higher Risk

#### 7. Native Code Extensions
Consider Cython or C++ extensions for:
- Aerodynamic force calculations
- RK4 integration kernel
- Critical path functions

#### 8. GPU Acceleration
```python
# CuPy-based trajectory integration for thousands of simultaneous trajectories
import cupy as cp

def gpu_integrate_trajectories(initial_states, force_params):
    # Parallel trajectory integration on GPU
    # Useful for Monte Carlo analysis (10,000+ trajectories)
```

#### 9. Approximation Models
```python
class MLAerodynamicsModel:
    """ML-based approximation of aerodynamic forces"""
    # Train neural network on physics calculations
    # 100x faster evaluation with ~1% error
```

|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Single At-Bat | 124 ms (fast mode) | 50 ms | 2.5x |
| 1,000 At-Bats | 2.1 minutes | 30 seconds | 4x |

| 1M At-Bats | 34 hours | 2 hours | 17x |

## Validation Strategy

For each optimization:
1. **Accuracy Validation**: Must pass all 7 benchmark tests in `validation.py`
2. **Performance Measurement**: Automated benchmarking with statistical significance
3. **Memory Profiling**: Ensure no memory leaks or excessive allocation
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify compatibility with existing features

## Memory Usage Optimization

### Current Memory Patterns
- 8-12 MB per 1000 at-bats (trajectory storage)
- Significant GC pressure from temporary arrays
- Object creation overhead in hot loops

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Object Pooling**: Reuse result objects
2. **Streaming Results**: Process and discard trajectory data
3. **Compressed Storage**: Store only essential metrics
4. **Memory Mapping**: Use mmap for large result sets

## Monitoring & Profiling

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Add performance monitoring to track regressions
@performance_monitor
def simulate_at_bat(self, verbose=False):
    # Automatic timing and memory tracking
    
# Continuous integration performance tests
def test_performance_regression():
    # Fail CI if performance degrades by >5%
```

### Profiling Tools
- `cProfile` for function-level profiling
- `memory_profiler` for memory usage tracking
- `line_profiler` for line-by-line analysis
- `py-spy` for production profiling

## Conclusion

The current simulation engine is already well-optimized with numba JIT compilation and fast_mode. However, significant additional performance gains (5-20x) are achievable through:

1. **Memory optimization** (pre-allocation, object pooling)
2. **Batch processing** (vectorized operations, reduced overhead)
3. **Physics approximations** (lookup tables, ML models)
4. **Specialized modes** (ultra-fast for bulk analysis)

The recommended approach is incremental implementation with careful validation to maintain the engine's empirical accuracy while achieving dramatic performance improvements for large-scale simulations.
