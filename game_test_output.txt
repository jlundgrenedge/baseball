BASEBALL GAME SIMULATION DEMO
==================================================

This demonstration shows the complete game simulation system
that integrates all physics components:
- Realistic pitch simulation
- Bat-ball collision physics
- Fielding mechanics with reaction time and range
- Baserunning physics and timing
- Complete play outcomes based on timing comparisons


==================================================
DEBUG METRICS LEVEL
==================================================
Enable simulation metrics tracking?

0 = OFF       (no overhead, production speed)
1 = BASIC     (summary stats only)
2 = DETAILED  (every pitch/play logged)
3 = EXHAUSTIVE (all internal calculations)

Recommended: 0 for speed, 1 for quick insights, 2 for analysis

Enter debug level (0-3, default 0):
